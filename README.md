## Thumbhash C++

This is a C++ implementation of the image compression algorithm written by [Evan Wallace](https://madebyevan.com). The primary use of this algorithm is to store the compact binary encoding so that a placeholder image can be displayed client side while the original file is loading asynchronously.

For a detailed description of how the algorithm works, please see https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/
