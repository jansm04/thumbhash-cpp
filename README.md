## Thumbhash C++

This is a C++ implementation of the image compression algorithm written by Evan Wallace. The primary use of this algorithm is to store a compact binary encoding of an image so that an approximate placeholder image can be displayed temporarily on the client side while the original file is loading asynchronously.

For a detailed description of how the algorithm works, please see https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/
